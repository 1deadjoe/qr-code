### Built With

Semantic HTML5 markup
CSS for styling

### What I Learned
While working on this project, I learned:
i. How to style a QR code component using CSS using flexbox. I had a hard time trying to center my content  
```css
body{
    .
    .
    .
    display: flex;
    .
    .
    .
}
```


ii. How to use Google Fonts to apply custom fonts to a webpage.
html 
``` html
<link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css2?family=Outfit:wght@100..900&display=swap" rel="stylesheet">
```


### Continued Development
In future projects, I aim to:
Explore more advanced CSS techniques for styling components.
Keep learning about responsive design principles for better compatibility across devices.
